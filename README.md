index.html: Provides the structure for the web page, including components such as the login form, search form, and movie display area.
main.css: Responsible for styling the web page to ensure it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
script.js: Contains the application logic, handling user authentication, API requests, and dynamic content generation.
